# MODELLER Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey learning **[MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller/)**, a software package for comparative protein structure modeling.  

It is structured as a series of lessons, each with:
- A **script** (`.py`) that can be run with MODELLER.
- A **README.md** explaining what the script does, what concepts are being learned, and expected outputs.

The goal is to turn this into a **practical, annotated guide** to MODELLER for myself and others.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this Repository
This repository is **not an original tutorial**.  
It is my personal journey of going through the official [MODELLER documentation](https://salilab.org/modeller/documentation.html) step by step.  

- The examples and workflows are adapted from the manual.  
- My contribution is to **organize, annotate, and explain** them in a way that supports learning.  
- All credit for the original methods, examples, and tools goes to the **Salilab MODELLER team**.
