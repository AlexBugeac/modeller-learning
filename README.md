# MODELLER Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey learning **[MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller/)**, a software package for comparative protein structure modeling.  

It is structured as a series of lessons, each with:
- A **script** (`.py`) that can be run with MODELLER.
- A **README.md** explaining what the script does, what concepts are being learned, and expected outputs.

The goal is to turn this into a **practical, annotated guide** to MODELLER for myself and others.
