# More Advanced Usage of MODELLER

This section goes beyond the basic introduction and covers **advanced features of MODELLER**.  
Each topic is organized in its own folder with:  

- Example **Python scripts** (`.py`)  
- Any necessary **input files** (e.g., PDB, alignment)  
- A **README.md** explaining the concept, usage, and expected results
